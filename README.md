# parser combinator

A parser combinator is a higher-order function that accepts several parsers as input and returns a new parser as 
its output, it is one of the most beautiful applications of functional programming. They offer an internal DSL to 
use for designing external DSLs so you donâ€™t have to implement your own language infrastructure as you do with other techniques of external DSL design


This is a very simple implementation of parser combinator with Kotlin, the goal is to implement a parser to read
a configuration file with multiple lines of key-value pairs, e.g:

```
height:100
width:50
depth:12
```
